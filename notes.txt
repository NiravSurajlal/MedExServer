Celery requires RabbitMQ (messaging service) which requires Erlang.
To start up RabbitMQ, use:   
    >> C:\Program Files\RabbitMQ Server\rabbitmq_server-3.10.5\sbin\rabbitmq-server
To start Celery use in \medex:
    >> celery -A medex worker -l info 
    >> celery -A myapp.celeryapp worker --loglevel=info -P eventlet

    Celery has issues on windows, so needed to install eventlet
